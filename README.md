## [Student Instruction Database & Analytics Project](Student%20Instruction%20Database%20%26%20Analysis%20Project)
PostgreSQL project with real-world implications, which developed a student database, and analyzed the efficacy of instruction techniques.
It was created to perform data analysis for instruction-related questions and scenarios. The goal of this database was to aid in the iterative improvement of instruction practices, through understanding of the relevant data, notably student assignment grades.
+ Design database schema visualization and key relationships.
+ Understand connection between tables.
+ Potentially identify and subsequently clean any data anomalies.
+ Analyze processed student data.
+ Find actionable insights for optimized session output.
+ Alter sessions based on data trends.

**Process**: Following the distinction of data types, column names and constraints, entity integrity was established through the assignment of a primary key column. This column denoted the unique instances of student data in each row. Referential integrity was maintained through foreign keys, which linked tables together by a commonality. These keys aided in the further understanding of the relationships between the students, their grades, and other internally contributing variables like session length. After the initial insertion of data, the tables in this database were continually updated over time and queries would be used to scan, gain insights, and maintain the overall integrity of the data. 

**Conclusion**: Postgres queries were used to filter information and draw conclusions on what should be altered in instruction methods, including session length, and length of time spent as a student. Through comparative processes and analysis, analysis was ultimately able to determine that a combination of shorter, more focused sessions were more conducive to higher grade averages for the studentsâ€™ essay assignments, observable after only a short period of time.
